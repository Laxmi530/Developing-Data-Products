Important Information
It is especially important to submit this assignment, because it must be graded by others. If you did not submit, there may not get score to pass the assignment. This makes it difficult - and in some cases, impossible - to produce a grade. Submit on time to avoid these risks.

Instructions

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!
Review criterialess 
The rubric contains the following two questions:

Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?
Is the web page a presentation and does it feature an interactive plot that appears to have been created with Plotly?
